# Welcome to Computer Vision!

This is an **ungraded** project will help you get up and running with a working environment! For those that are familiar with this setup -- let's rehash anyways.
We'll focus on install a few crucial tools to help us maintain consistent environments between students.

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
- [Git Bash (Only necessary for Windows)](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge)

## Visual Studio Code

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) is **recommended** for this course for a few reasons.

- Consistent development environment (so the teaching staff can more easily help!)
- Ease of integration with Jupyter Notebooks and `git`.

### macOS Users (Optional)

`brew` is a very useful package management tool for `macOS`. It can make some of the above installation even simpler.

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
brew install --cask visual-studio-code
brew install gh
```

## Visual Studio Code Extensions

Download the following extensions:

- [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
- [Remote Development Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack)

*Note: confirm that all the extensions are installed/enabled before continuing. 

## Environment Setup

We will be using Mamba/Miniforge to create a consistent Python environment for running and testing our code. For each project, we will create a new conda environment with slightly different packages (specified in `environment.yml`). You will need to install Miniforge before you can start working in these environments.

### Option A: Install Miniforge

Miniforge is a minimal installer for the Conda package manager that comes with Mamba pre-installed and uses `conda-forge` as the default channel.

1. Visit the [Miniforge GitHub repository](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge%23download).
2. Scroll to the "Downloads" section and download the installer appropriate for your operating system and architecture.
3. Run the installer. We recommend allowing the installer to initialize your shell when prompted.

### Option B: Configure an Existing Conda Installation

If you already have Anaconda or Miniconda installedï¼š

* On Windows:

  ```bash
  conda init powershell
  conda install mamba -n base -c conda-forge
  ```

* On macOS & Linux:

  ```bash
  conda install mamba -n base -c conda-forge
  ```

## Setting up Project 0

In VSCode, open the unzipped project folder. In the `conda` folder, you will see an installation script, `install.sh`. Running this script will create your `conda` environment, which should then be activated. On macOS, you can run this script by navigating to the `conda` directory in a terminal and running `./install.sh.` On Windows, use the Miniforge Prompt instead of the built-in terminal and run the command `.\install.sh` instead. Doing so will require [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

If you do not see `cv_proj0` at the start of each line of your VSCode command prompt, you will need to manually activate your environment with the following commands from the root of your repository.

```bash
conda activate cv_proj0
pip install -e .
```

If the install script does not work for you, you may alternatively run the following set of commands from the `project-0` directory.

```
cd conda
mamba env create -f environment.yml
cd ..
conda activate cv_proj0
pip install -e .
```

**Important Note**: Once you have created the project environment, you'll need to select it as the `Default Interpreter`. Open up the Command Palette and search for `Python: Create Environment`. Then select the environment you just created from the menu.

## Unit Test Setup

We will use `pytest` in this class as a testing framework. This will run unit tests on your code to verify correctness. Some of the unit tests will given to you as a courtesy; however, others will be run at submission time.

### Run the unit tests

The following command will run all unit tests in the `tests` folder.

```bash
pytest tests
```

The unit tests will initially fail -- modify `src/vision/linalg.py` and see if you can pass the tests!

## Jupyter Notebook

Each project (except this one) will have a jupyter notebook which will allow you to run and test your code in an interactive Python coding environment. Jupyter notebook should already be installed, but if not you can visit [this page](https://jupyter.org/install) to install.

You can open these notebooks directly in VSCode or use the following command to start a jupter notebook session:
```bash
jupyter notebook ./<file_name>.ipynb
```

Once in the notebook, you can edit text cells by double-clicking on them and edit/run code cells (use the shortcut cmd+enter or shift+enter to run code cells).

## Submission
To create the zip file to upload on gradescope, run the following from within your conda environment.

```
python submission.py --gt_username your_username
```

# Conclusion

We hope this project helped you get your environment setup for this course. If you have any questions / concerns, please post on [piazza](https://piazza.com).
